# OpenWeatherMap-TomTom
Integrating OpenWeatherMap Tiles with the TomTom Maps APIs!

As seen on our YouTube channel, we streamed on how to add weather tiles to a TomTom Map. Find our YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL-ZtGd70Khd_9OJACd6rXA

This is the video: https://youtu.be/6oEPjwVYEYg

All that's needed are a TomTom Developers account and API key, the basic Web SDK setup, and an OpenWeatherMap access key.

You can get started with a TomTom Developer Portal account right here:https://developer.tomtom.com/

And with OpenWeatherMap here: https://openweathermap.org/

This code initializes a basic TomTom Map, and adds raster tiles for both the cloud and precipitation layers from OpenWeatherMap. Check out how to get started with our Web SDK if you need extra help: https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-web-js/tutorials-basic/display-vector-map

Lastly, we created popups which display a weather icon (sunny, cloudy, partially sunny etc), the temperature, and weather condition ("clear") for 5 cities within a nearby radius of a click event on the map.

Happy Mapping!
