# OpenWeatherMap-TomTom
Integrating OpenWeatherMap Tiles with the TomTom Maps APIs!

As seen on our YouTube channel, we streamed on how to add eather tiles to a TomTom Map.

All that's needed are a TomTom Developers account and API key, the basic Web SDK setup, and an OpenWeatherMap access key.

This code initializes a basic TomTom Map, and adds raster tiles for both the cloud and precipitation layers from OpenWeatherMap.

Lastly, we created popups which display a weather icon (sunny, cloudy, partially sunny etc), the temperature, and weather condition ("clear") for 5 cities within a nearby radius of a click event on the map.

Happy Mapping!
